  "Provides a way to register atoms that can later all be reset to their initial values.
   This enables changes to Braid modules to be picked up in a reloaded workflow (ie. figwheel).

  On the client-side:
  Figwheel is configured to call (braid.core.client.desktop.core/reload!),
  which calls (braid.core.modules/init!), which calls (reset-all!)

  On the server-side:
  (braid.core.modules/init!) is called once, when the server is started (in braid.core)."
